However, as the project progressed, the client already had D365 in place and wanted a more streamlined solution. We then collaborated closely to find a middle ground, focusing on delivering a customized dashboard that integrated seamlessly with their existing D365 system instead of building redundant features. This experience taught me to stay flexible in project scoping and always anticipate potential changes in client needs. It also highlighted the importance of designing with compatibility in mind, ensuring our solutions can adapt to the client's existing tech stack rather than forcing them to overhaul their workflow."
